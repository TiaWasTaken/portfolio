## üìß Contact Form Integration

The contact form is powered by **EmailJS**, allowing users to send messages directly through the site. EmailJS provides a seamless connection without the need for a custom backend.

### Contact Form Setup:

1. **Create an account on [EmailJS](https://emailjs.com)**.
2. **Configure your EmailJS service**, template, and user keys.
3. **Update the form configuration** in `contact.jsx`:

```jsx
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setLoading(true);

  emailjs
    .send(
      'your_service_id', 
      'your_template_id', 
      {
        from_name: form.name,
        to_name: 'Your Name',
        from_email: form.email,
        to_email: 'your_email@example.com',
        message: form.message,
      },
      'your_public_key'
    )
    .then(() => {
      setLoading(false);
      alert('Thank you. I will get back to you as soon as possible.');
      setForm({ name: '', email: '', message: '' });
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      setLoading(false);
      console.log(error);
      alert('Something went wrong.');
    });
};
```
